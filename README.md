# flutter_sqflite_testing

A flutter project to test out sqflite

## Libraries used

1. [Riverpod](https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod) as a DI and state management tool.
2. [Path](https://pub.dev/packages/path) to create path to store the sqlite database.
3. [Sqflite](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite) to create and manipulate the database.

## Improvements
Can use other libraries/plugins to allow streams to be emitted from the database to remove some boilerplate code.
