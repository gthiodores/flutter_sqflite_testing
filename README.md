# flutter_sqflite_testing

A flutter project to test out sqflite

## Libraries used

1. [Riverpod](https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod) as a DI and state management tool.
2. [Path](https://pub.dev/packages/path) to create path to store the sqlite database.
3. [Sqflite](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite) to create and manipulate the database.

## Improvements
1. Can use other libraries/plugins/packages to allow streams to be emitted from the database to remove some boilerplate code.
2. Can use a different database library/plugin/package to generate codes instead.
3. Add messages to the State class to generate snackbar messages with them.
